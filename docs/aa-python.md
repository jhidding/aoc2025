Python
======

Most of us know a little Python. A lot of problems in Advent of Code benefit from using NumPy and maybe sometimes a parser library. However, here I'll force myself to use only the Python standard library, which is quite extensive. Especially the `itertools`, `functools` and `collections` libraries turn out to be extremely useful, in addition to the standard typing libraries like `typing`, `collections.abc` and `dataclasses`.
